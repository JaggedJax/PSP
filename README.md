# PSP
PHP Starter Project, aka PHP PSP

The goal of PSP is to build a set of easy-to-use basic building blocks to help anyone quick get started with a PHP project.
PSP is not aiming to be the most flexible and powerful set of tools, but the most practical tools with a very low learning curve and sane defaults.

This project is not yet in a working state.
